1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mern-elearning.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd mern-elearning`
3. Install dependencies for both server and client:
      cd server
      npm install
      cd ../client
      npm install

4. Set up environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add necessary environment variables such as MongoDB URI, Razorpay API key, etc.
5. Start the development server:
- In one terminal, navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm start`.
- In another terminal, navigate to the `client` directory and run `npm start`.
